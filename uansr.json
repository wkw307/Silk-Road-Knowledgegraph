It uses a combined criterion for initiation of upward streamer and leader discharges form the elements of the object and lightning diverters. This criterion takes into account the probabilistic nature of avalanche\u2013streamer and streamer\u2013leader transitions and also the trajectories of the lightning\u2019s downward stepped leader and lightning current. It has been shown that, if the formation of the downward leader of incomplete streamer discharges from the elements of the object in an electric field is neglected (these discharges may set fire on explosive emissions), the probability of lightning-induced failure of the object is underestimated by several times compared with the calculated value. \u00a9 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was measured as a function of vapor quality. Totally 414 experimental data points were obtained, with the parameter range of vapor quality from 0.01 to 0.99, pressure from 0.84 to 2.29 MPa, heat flux from 9 to 98.8 kW/m2, and mass flux from 110 to 800 kg/m2 s. The effects of vapor quality, heat flux, mass flux, and pressure on the HTC are explored. Four flow patterns are identified by analyzing the HTC data, including bubbly flow, annular flow with liquid in the core and vapor between the liquid and the tube wall, dispersed flow, and mist flow. The trend of the HTC along the tube length (with vapor quality) is explained in relation to flow patterns. The flow and heat transfer characteristics in the experiments are compared with those in horizontal macro-tubes. Substantial differences between these two flow directions are",

		"summary": "A theoretical design of a Ku-band multibeam offset bifocal dual-reflector antenna (BFRA) with 40\u00b0 field of view (FoV) suitable for satellite ground station applications is presented and discussed. The BFRA has a nearly square aperture with a dimension of about 4.5 m (191 wavelengths at a frequency of 12.75 GHz) and was designed for the required scan angle \u03b1 = 18\u00b0. The antenna has a Gregorian configuration in the offset vertical plane and a Cassegranian configuration in the scanning horizontal plane. This BFRA was designed for a special application for which providing the maximum aperture efficiency (AE) (i.e., the maximum gain) is required and relatively high sidelobes are allowed. The calculated AE is greater than 52% and a directivity is about 54 dBi at 12.75 GHz within the whole FoV of 40\u00b0 (which is equal to 100 beamwidths) in the scanning plane. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.",

The formulation of the boundary conditions at the vapor liquid interface to solve the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the distribution of molecules by velocity is a sophisticated problem. It appears that molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) can be used to provide this solution at the interface. The specific problems occur in the realization of MDS on large time and space scales. Some of these problems, and a hierarchy of continuum, kinetic and molecular dynamic time scales, are discussed in the paper.

The corresponding solution is in good agreement with that computed by using the Oswald-Kasper-Gaukler (OKG) model, which is extended to the case of layers of finite thickness. The second method is based on the discrete ordinate formalism and relies on a transformation of the AC equations to the algebraic Ricatti and Lyapunov equations, which are solved by using the backward differential formula.

A numerical simulation was done with the help of the mathematical model, which had been used previously for a numerical simulation of heat and mass transfer processes in different types of metal hydride reactors during sorption/desorption processes. The results illustrate that the major factors that reduce the rate of sorption, and consequently the efficiency of the system, are increasing the temperature of the reactor and the pressure drop, which is due to filtering the mixture through a metal hydride bed with low permeability. It is shown that the use of aluminium foam allows us to realise a more effective system for hydrogen purification from impurities, compared to a case without aluminium foam, while the volumetric capacity of the system is reduced slightly (9%). Increasing pressure at the reactor inlet\u00a0also increases the efficiency of the system. \u00a9 2",

We compare the magnetic excitations of the four different magnetically ordered phases (A-type antiferromagnetic, sinusoidally modulated collinear, helical phases with spin planes perpendicular to the crystallographic a and c axes). The transition between the two latter phases goes hand in hand with a switching of the ferroelectric polarization from Pa to Pc. Special emphasis is paid to the temperature dependence of the excitations at this transition. We find a significant change of intensity indicating that the exchange-striction mechanism may not be the only mechanism to induce dipolar weight to spin-wave excitations. We also focus on excitations within the incommensurate collinear antiferromagnetic phase and find an excitation close to 40cm-1.

We employ polarized, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling (SPC) effects for the two representative compositions x=0.1 and x=0.3. We observe an enhancement of phonon frequencies by Ho3+ substitution and we use the Ag(4) mode as a measure to evaluate the orthorhombic distortion angle \u03b8. SPC manifests itself as mode-specific softening for T<100 K, induced by the magnetic ordering of Mn3+ spins.

In this method, a simplified expression of the reflection coefficient is derived in the Darcy's regime (low frequency range), which does not depend on frequency and porosity. Numerical simulations show that the reflection coefficient of a porous material can be approximated by its simplified expression obtained from its Taylor development to the first order. This approximation is good especially for resistive materials (of low permeability) and for the lower frequencies. The permeability is reconstructed by solving the inverse problem using waves reflected by plastic foam samples, at different frequency bandwidths in the Darcy regime. The proposed method has the advantage of being simple compared to the conventional methods that use experimental reflected data, and is complementary to the transmissivity method, which is more adapted to low resistive materials (high permeability). \u00a9",

The problem has been solved with the use of an original procedure of transforming the function of distribution of vapor molecules, with the transformation being caused by the interaction of the molecules with the particles. The condensation sites present in the vapor have been shown to significantly influence its macroscopic parameters. In particular, the condensation on the nanoparticles significantly reduces the mass flux transmitted from one surface to another.

The evaporation coefficient is \u02dc0.8, which is in good agreement with the data in the literature. The condensation coefficient determined as the proportionality factor in the Hertz formula is a conventional parameter, the value of which is varied depending on many factors. In the absence of evaporation, the condensation coefficient is approximately unity, whereas at a moderate evaporation flow this value decreases by a factor of about two. The temperature jump near the interface surface measured in many experimental studies has nothing to do with the real temperature difference between the liquid and the vapor. The measurable temperature jump has been determined in this study; it is about 10 K near the surface and depends on the distance ",

Two variants of cable location were considered: along the axis of the cryostat and on the bottom surface of the cryostat. Available data from the literature were used for verification of different turbulence models. The verification results of low-Reynolds-number turbulence models (k-\u03b5 N k-\u03c9) and the algebraic LVEL model showed that these models of turbulence describe the friction factor (hydraulic-resistance coefficient) for the annuli quite accurately. However, experimental data for transversally corrugated channels were reproduced with much greater accuracy using the algebraic LVEL model and the k-\u03c9 turbulence model. The dependencies of the friction factor from the Reynolds number for corrugated cryostat with HTS cable located concentrically for different values of corrugation pitch and corrugation depth were calculated.

The obtained solution is used to calculate the heat flux density in film boiling on a cylindrical heating surface in the case where the film thickness is comparable to the diameter of the heater. The motion of the normal component of the superfluid liquid in pores is described by equations that take into account heat and mass transfer in superfluid helium.

The combined reflected signal is correlated with the probing signal; in ultrasonic defectoscopy of products it has to be considered as interference that masks the echo signals from the initial defects of the product. At the same time, it provides information on the structural state of a studied material.

This justifies the need for materials with useful SAW resonator properties and with the largest difference between temperature coefficients of frequency (TCF) for a resonator pair on a single substrate.

		"summary": "Results of detailed theoretical studies of widely used Dolph-Chebyshev and Barsilon-Temes windows are presented. It is proved that the normalized spectrums of these windows are identically determined by a finite number of cosine functions. In the case of application of Chebyshev functions of the first and second kinds of even order, cosine functions of even arguments are used, and cosine function of odd arguments are used for Chebyshev functions of an odd order. Using the sum of Dolph-Chebyshev and BarsilonTemes window functions defined by a sequence of Chebyshev functions of adjacent orders, new window functions with a standard main lobe and essentially suppressed sidelobes are developed. \u00a9 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",
